The My Friend Finder App is an excercise in Full Stack development. We were tasked with creating an app. Specifically an app that takes in user information, sends it to a Heroku server, and then matches user questions and returns which friends best match each other.

We used Heroku for the hosting and backend and dynamically created webpages using Handlebars. App and api routing was though JavaScript and NodeJS.
